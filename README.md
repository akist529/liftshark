# LiftShark

A fitness tracker app that allows users to measure their workout activity and monitor changes in their progress. Exercise data is pulled from a third-party API where users can filter them by muscle group and add them to their workout journal. Users can also create routines for each day of the week in order to maintain consistency, and log their weight and body measurements as well.
